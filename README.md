# How to create a React project with Vite

1. pnpm create vite
2. project-name
3. React
4. Choose TypeScript + SWC
5. cd project_name
6. pnpm i
7. pnpm run dev

There are 2 different types of files, you'll face:
1. ts (used for writing typeScript code)
2. tsx (used for writing HTML) (x means xml)
(xml has strict rules:
1. The name of the method should be capital
2. Every tag must be closed
)
